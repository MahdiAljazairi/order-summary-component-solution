## Tools

- [Dev Docs](https://devdocs.io) - The resource I was referring to throughout the process. It's an offline web app that has a huge collection of documentations.
- [Brackets](https://brackets.io) - My text editor. Not as powerful as VSCode, but still my favorite.
- Chrome - This web page was only tested on Chrome.
